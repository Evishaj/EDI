                    <strong>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.</strong> is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury automobiles.
                    Lamborghini's production facility and headquarters are located in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.
                    Italian manufacturing magnate Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined
                    grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models were 
                    introduced in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for
                    the Miura sports coup√©, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars
                    of the era.

                    <strong> Automobiles Ford Mustang</strong> is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. 
                    In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. 
                    Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment,
                    the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially
                    distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.[3]
                    Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model
                    A.[4] Introduced on April 17, 1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth
                    Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965
                    Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.[7]

                    <strong>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti</strong> was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles.
                    The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti.
                    The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories. Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35 Grand 
                    Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car.
                    The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow for the marque, and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 meant
                    that there was no successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and it 
                    released one last model in the 1950s before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.
                    In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name and revived it as Bugatti Automobili SpA.
