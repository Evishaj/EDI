            <h1 class="mt-3">Lamborghini</h1>
            <p class="mt-5 ms-5"><strong>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.</strong> is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury automobiles.
                 Lamborghini's production facility and headquarters are located in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.
                 Italian manufacturing magnate Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined
                 grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models were 
                 introduced in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for
                 the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars
                 of the era.
                 Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and
                 the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974.
                 The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980, 
                 who purchased the company for US$3 million, renaming it Nuova Automobili Lamborghini SpA. As CEO and President, Patrick Mimran 
                 invested heavily in the company's expansion, and was later credited as being the man who saved Lamborghini. Under his management,
                 Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa entry-level sports car and the LM002 high performance
                 off-road vehicle.
                 Patrick Mimran sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987 for US$25 million. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo
                 and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group 
                 V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the
                 control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and this increased
                 productivity for the brand.</p>

            <h1 class="ms-5 mt-5">Mustang</h1>
            <p class="mt-5 ms-5 mb-6"><strong> Automobiles Ford Mustang</strong> is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. 
                 In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. 
                 Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment,
                 the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially
                 distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.[3]
                 Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model
                 A.[4] Introduced on April 17, 1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth
                 Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965
                 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.[7]
                 The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and
                 Pontiac Firebird[8] (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger[9] (1970). The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupes
                 worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). 
                 The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the 1970s, it included
                 more features and was marketed as a personal luxury car.
                 From 1965 until 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel-drive throughout its 
                 production. From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. From 1974 until 1978, the Mustang
                 (denoted Mustang II) was a longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Pinto. From 1979 until 2004, the Mustang shared its Fox platform 
                 chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles (becoming the final one to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford has produced two generations
                 of the Mustang, each using a distinct platform unique to the model line.
                 Through its production, multiple nameplates have been associated with the Ford Mustang series, including GT, Mach 1, Boss 302/429, 
                 Cobra (separate from Shelby Cobra), and Bullitt, along with "5.0" fender badging (denoting 4.9 L OHV or 5.0 L DOHC V8 engines).</p>

            <h1 class="mt-5 ms-5">Bugatti</h1>
            <p clas="ms-5 mt-5"> <strong>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti</strong> was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles.
                 The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti.
                 The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories. Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35 Grand 
                 Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car.
                 The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow for the marque, and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 meant
                 that there was no successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and it 
                 released one last model in the 1950s before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.
                 In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name and revived it as Bugatti Automobili SpA.</p>
